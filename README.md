# Well it's been quite a while  

I am reworking these themes based on the updated elementary stylesheet as well as creating more based on some of my favorite GTK3 themes.  

[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## TODO

* Not sure, whatever I think of or is requested that I can do

## Personal notes

I have zero idea why this repository randomly gets attention from time to time but thats cool.  Im always thinking of different themes I can create
but plank only has so many options so it's tough.
