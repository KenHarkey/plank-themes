# Well it's been quite a while  
I am reworking these themes based on the updated elementary stylesheet as well as creating more based on some of my favorite GTK3 themes.  

## Changelog
* 1-Aug-2020 initial commit.  Added a shadow to anti-shade and changed color to match elementary os 5 a bit better (hopefully) / Added install script I yoinked from another repository
